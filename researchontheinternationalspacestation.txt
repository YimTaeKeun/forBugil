The International Space Station is different from other laboratories on Earth because of its very low gravity, or micro-gravity. Much of the research designed to take place on the ISS utilizes the micro-gravity on the station in one way or another. Special kinds of experiments can be done in micro-gravity which could never be done properly on Earth.//One area of research involves protein crystal studies. Proteins are the basic elements of life. In micro-gravity, it is possible to grow crystal proteins that are much more pure than those that can be grown on Earth. These crystals could help scientists understand proteins, enzymes, and viruses better.//This research could lead to the development of new drugs, which could treat viral infections, such as HIV, as well as other kinds of diseases.//Tissue cultures from various parts of the human body, such as skin, are useful for testing new medical treatments without the possibility of harming real patients. //The micro-gravity on the ISS will allow the growth of stronger and more natural tissue cultures than on Earth. These can be tested more thoroughly and will probably show more natural reactions than Earth-based tissue cultures. The result could be new treatments for cancer, diabetes, and other serious illnesses.//There are many other kinds of research which can only take place on the ISS. All of this research has the potential to improve life on Earth. However, no one can tell what will eventually come of all this research.//
