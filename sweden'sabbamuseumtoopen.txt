STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The catchy tunes, outlandish costumes and shimmering boots that made ABBA a global phenomenon all feature in a new museum dedicated to the band, but rumors the exhibition may presage a reunion by Sweden’s most famous export were quickly quashed. The permanent exhibition within a hall of fame of Swedish pop music opens in Stockholm this week and organizers hope to attract hundreds of thousands of visitors annually on a pop nostalgia trip.////Visitors will be able to sing along to ABBA hits alongside life size holograms of the group - and then download the images to their web account.////“I would be interested, even if I hated ABBA, about how it actually happened and why,” former ABBA member Bjorn Ulvaeus said on Monday at the museum.////Ulvaeus, now a 68-year-old grandfather, rejected suggestions the opening could coincide with the band reuniting. A British bookmaker was taking bets in April on an ABBA comeback after singer Agnetha Faltskog hinted at a possible reunion.////“As you all know we have never reunited,” Ulvaeus said. “So I take this opportunity to say now we are not going to either.”////ABBA, made up of Ulvaeus, Faltskog, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Benny Andersson, shot to fame when they won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with the song “Waterloo”.////To revive their heyday, the museum has a 1970s disco dance floor to practice your moves, audition recordings for a “fifth” member of the band and the opportunity to sit inside the famous helicopter that featured on the “Arrival” album cover.////“RING RING”//A mockup of the old ABBA studio features a self-playing piano connected to Andersson’s current music studio - each time the musician plays on it, the piano plays as well.////The museum walls are plastered with newspaper cuttings, fan mail and videos. Visitors can peer into a behind-the-scenes dressing room, admire ABBA’s gold and platinum discs and see a reconstruction of the Swedish cabin where they composed songs.////Based on the band’s first major hit “Ring Ring”, the museum also includes a red telephone. Only the four band members have the number, and they promise occasionally to call it and speak to surprised visitors.////After ABBA, Ulvaeus went on to become a businessman and helped to produce the hugely successful “Mamma Mia!” musical that was later turned into a film. He has been the main ABBA member behind the museum.////ABBA became one of Sweden’s biggest exports with hit songs like “Dancing Queen” and “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)”.////The group sold around 370 million records in total and are part of a rich Swedish pop tradition which includes Roxette, Ace of Base, Europe and Kent.////But the museum took a long time coming. Separate plans for an earlier ABBA museum were shelved in 2008.////Stockholm has been struck by a bout of ABBA fever in the buildup to the opening. Visitors to the international airport are greeted by life-size pictures of the group as well as dancing Spitting Image puppets.////Baggage belts have “Gimme Gimme Gimme” emblazoned on the sides. “I walked with Frida yesterday around the museum and she had a tear in her eye,” said museum director Ingmarie Halling, ABBA’s former costumer and hair designer from 1977 to 1980.////“Here you follow the footpath of ABBA. But you have to walk gently when you tell someone else’s story.”////
