History of the Maori Language////Decline and revival//In the last 200 years, the history of the Maori language (te reo Maori) has been one of ups and downs. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was the predominant language spoken in Aotearoa (the Maori name for New Zealand). As more English speakers arrived in New Zealand, the Maori language was increasingly confined to Maori communities. By the mid-20th century, there were concerns that the language was dying out. Major initiatives launched from the 1980s have brought about a revival of the Maori language. In the early 21st century, more than 130,000 people of Maori ethnicity could speak and understand Maori, one of the three official languages of New Zealand.////Maori: a common means of communication//For the first half century or so of European settlement of New Zealand, the Maori language was a common way of communicating. Early settlers had to learn to speak the language if they wished to trade with Maori because settlers were dependent on Maori for many things at this time.////Up to the 1870s, it was not unusual for government officials, missionaries, and prominent Pakeha to speak Maori. Their children often grew up with Maori children and were among the most fluent European speakers and writers of Maori. Particularly in rural areas, the interaction between Maori and Pakeha was constant. //Korero Pakeha (“Speak English”)//Pakeha were in the majority by the early 1860s, and English became the dominant language of New Zealand. Increasingly, the Maori language was confined to Maori communities that existed separately from the Pakeha majority.////The Maori language was not understood as an essential expression and envelope of Maori culture, important for the Maori in maintaining their pride and identity as a people. Maori was now officially discouraged. Many Maori themselves questioned its relevance in a Pakeha-dominated world where the most important value seemed to be to get ahead as an individual.////The Maori language was suppressed in schools, either formally or informally, so that Maori youngsters could assimilate with the wider community. Some older Maori still recall being punished for speaking their language. Many Maori parents encouraged their children to learn English and even to turn away from other aspects of Maori custom. Increasing numbers of Maori people learned English because they needed it in the workplace or places of recreation such as the football field. “Korero Pakeha” (Speak English) was seen as essential for Maori people.////A language lives//Despite the emphasis on speaking English, the Maori language persisted. Until the Second World War most Maori spoke Maori as their first language. They worshipped in Maori, and Maori was the language of the marae. Political meetings were conducted in Maori, and there were Maori newspapers and literature. More importantly, it was the language of the home, and parents could pass on the language to their children. //The lure of the city////The Second World War brought about momentous changes for Maori society. There was plenty of work available in towns and cities due to the war, and Maori moved into urban areas in greater numbers. Before the war, about 75 percent of Maori lived in rural areas. Two decades later, approximately 60 percent lived in urban centers.////English was the language of urban New Zealand – at work, in school, and in leisure activities. Maori children went to city schools where Maori was unheard of in teaching programs. The new, enforced contact of large numbers of Maori and Pakeha caused much strain and stress, and the language was one of the things to suffer.////The number of Maori speakers began to decline rapidly. By the 1980s, less than 20 percent of Maori knew enough of their traditional language to be regarded as native speakers. Even for those people, Maori was ceasing to be the language of everyday use in the home. Some urbanized Maori people became divorced from their language and culture. Others maintained contact with their original communities, returning for important hui (meetings) and tangihanga (funerals) or allowing the kaumatua (elders) at home to adopt or care for their children.////Seeds of change//From the 1970s, many Maori people reasserted their identity as Maori. An emphasis on the language as an integral part of Maori culture was central to this. Maori leaders were increasingly recognizing the dangers of the loss of Maori language. New groups emerged that were committed to strengthening Maori culture and the language.////Major Maori language recovery programs began in the 1980s. Many were targeted at young people and the education system, such as a system of primary schooling in a Maori-language environment.//Legislating for change////Efforts to secure the survival of the Maori language stepped up in 1985. In that year the Waitangi Tribunal heard the Te Reo Maori claim, which asserted that the Maori language was a taonga (a treasure) that government was obliged to protect under the Treaty of Waitangi. The Waitangi Tribunal agreed with the Maori and recommended a number of laws and policies. In 1987, Maori was made an official language of New Zealand.////There are now many institutions working to recover the language. Even so, the decline of the Maori language has only just been arrested. There is a resurgence of Maori, but to survive as a language, it needs enough fluent speakers of all ages as well as the respect and support of the wider English-speaking and multi-ethnic New Zealand community.////
