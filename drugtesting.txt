Random drug testing is used by professional sports associations to catch athletes who are illegally trying to enhance their performance. In 1995, the US Supreme Court ruled that it was also legal for high schools and middle schools to randomly test student athletes for drugs. More recently, in 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that random drug tests could also be given to any student participating in school-related competitions, from chess clubs to state math competitions.//In an online survey conducted by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) and other groups in 2003, it was determined that 13 percent of the nationâ€™s high schools currently have a drug-testing policy in effect. Of these schools, 63 percent require drug testing for participation in athletic programs, while 20 percent test the entire student body. In 83 percent of participating schools, drug testing is mandatory, and in 76 percent of schools testing is done randomly.//There are several reasons for the relatively low rate of implementation of drug testing programs in US public schools. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other groups have argued that the Supreme Court decisions are an invasion of privacy and a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which protects individuals from unreasonable search and seizure. Additionally, drug-testing programs may be considered too expensive in schools with budget constraints.//
